hey everyone, quick standup notes from this week:

MONDAY:
- jen started working on the payment gateway integration
- design team presented 3 options to stakeholders, they loved option B
- QA found a critical bug in checkout flow, assigned to alex

TUESDAY:
- alex fixed the checkout bug and pushed to staging
- we finally got access to the production environment!! only took IT 2 weeks lol
- payment gateway integration is harder than expected, stripe api docs are confusing
- client called - they want to move launch date UP to nov 1st instead of nov 15th 😬

WEDNESDAY:
- emergency meeting about the new timeline... not looking good tbh
- jen still stuck on payment gateway, might need to bring in a contractor
- ran load testing - system crashed at 500 concurrent users, need to scale infrastructure
- marketing team already promoting nov 1st launch on social media (nobody told them we havent agreed to it yet)

THURSDAY:
- performance team investigating the load testing failures
- legal still hasnt approved the privacy policy updates, holding up EU launch
- tried to reach out to stripe support, ticket opened but no response yet
- team morale is pretty low after the timeline discussion

FRIDAY:
- GOOD NEWS: alex found the performance bottleneck! was a database index issue, fixed now
- retested with 2000 concurrent users - passed!!
- jen made progress on payments but still not done, maybe 60% complete
- scheduled contractor interview for monday to help with payment integration
- budget meeting got cancelled, rescheduled for next friday
- oh and our devops engineer sara is going on vacation next week for 10 days... perfect timing 🙄

OTHER STUFF:
- need to set up monitoring and alerting before launch
- documentation is way behind
- nobody has tested the mobile responsive design yet
- the CEO keeps asking for demos but we dont have a stable build to show

CONCERNS:
- nov 1st date seems impossible with payment gateway incomplete
- losing sara for 10 days is gonna hurt
- legal approval usually takes 3-4 weeks, we only have 2 weeks until "launch"
- contractor might need ramp-up time
- marketing already promoting a date we havent committed to
- budget meeting delay means we cant approve contractor spend yet

NEXT WEEK:
- finish payment integration (jen + contractor hopefully)
- complete mobile testing
- get legal approval on privacy policy
- set up production monitoring
- pray everything works 🙏
